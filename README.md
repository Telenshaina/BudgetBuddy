# BudgetBuddy
This is a final project in Design and Analysis of Algorithm (DSA) made by second-year Computer Science students of New Era University.

Budget Buddy is a comprehensive expense-tracking program. In a world where managing finances can be overwhelming, Budget Buddy is here to simplify your life. This intuitive program lets you organize your bills and expenses, prioritizing what should be paid first.

With Budget Buddy, you start with a fixed budget, and every bill or expense you add will be deducted, keeping you on track. You can create a list of side expenses—those everyday purchases that aren’t necessarily bills, like buying lunch or getting a coffee. This list allows you to track your spending more closely, giving you a complete picture of your financial habits.

Budget Buddy also provides an overview of your total bills, side expenses, and the amount you’ll save from your budget. With this information at your fingertips, you can make informed financial decisions and ensure that you never miss a payment or overspend. Also, Budget Buddy will give you an overview of the percentage of your expenses this month and the next one.

Budget, your Buddy, will take control of your finances with ease and confidence. No more guesswork, no more stress—just simple, organized budgeting that helps you achieve your financial goals.
